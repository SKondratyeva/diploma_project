# Diploma Project: Watermark Removal

## Plan

Stage 1

1. Overview of existing methods and research
2. Generate basic dataset. I plan to start with 1-2 standard watermarks on high-resolution images.
3. Prepare a pipeline for testing various models. 

Stage 2

1. Test various existing models and pick up the best one
2. Finetune the model until satisfactory results are achieved on the limited dataset.

Stage 3

1. In case HSE provides extra capacity, it is possible to adapt a model for a wider range of watermarks.
2. Create a web application that will be able to remove watermarks.
